Character Generator is what can help you. \nCharacter Generator (CG) will generate for you a unique description that you'll want to embody in your drawings.\nAt each step, you will be offered a choice of 3 options: skin color, hair length, even race (why not?). You will need to choose one. Or not one. Don't limit your fantasies. \nDon't like what CG suggested? You can shuffle the options again. Didn't like anything? Suggest your answer by clicking on the question. We'll surely add it.\nGood luck in your work creators!"
